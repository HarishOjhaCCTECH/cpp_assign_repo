this assignment is about converting .STL files to txt files for plotting on gnuplot. It stores the data in structured and optimised way  

=>Folder named "GNUfiles" contains the txt files to plot the 3d figure in gnuplot using the gnu console  
=>Folder named "STLfiles" contain the stl files of cube and sphere which are used as data source  
=>Folder named "headers" contain all the header files to be accessed by other files  
=>Folder named "output" contains the .exe file which is necessary for compiling the program  
=>Folder named "src" contain all the .cpp files for their repective header files. These files contain the definitions of declarations made in header files  
=>File named "main.cpp" is the entry point of program
=>File named "reduntantCode.txt" is like a rough notebook, where code is written before using it in the project to avoid bugs from being created and it also 
  the storage place for the unnecessary code
